- 👋 Hi, I’m @wondercreator007
- 👀 I’m interested in microcontroller(also fpga) and some programming technique.I love to use the instruments of TI company.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the resources embedded on fpga(in fact EP4CE10F17C8N) and how to complete a project based on stm32f103.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the projects launched by my college school--Wuhan University.I love electronic engineering.I want to have my abilities developed during the process of completing projects.
- 📫 How to reach me :I often use QQ:782734808，and literally my often used emil--782734808@qq.com
- 😄 Pronouns:No destruction, no establishment.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once peed in our experiment building when a beautiful girl look up in my direction.And it was a coincidence that the door is open wide...So I was really akward then...Even now looking back to that moment...
  And the girl I first confess my love to is a lesbian.Guess how I knew that?It's at the moment I did confess to her......
